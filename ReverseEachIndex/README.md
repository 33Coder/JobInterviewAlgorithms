# Reverse Each Index
**Problem Definition:** 
In this algorithm you are tasked with writing a function that takes in an array as an argument; write code to reverse the order 
of each of the indexes contents.

---
**Examples:***
* Array that is given: `["Reverse", "my", "order"]`
* Expected Output: `["esreveR", "ym", "redro"]`

---
**Notes:**
* Try to make this as efficient as possible by using built in functions that are native to your specific programming language!
